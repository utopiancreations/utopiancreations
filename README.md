### üöÄ My Projects

I build applications that prioritize community, privacy, and meaningful connection.

#### Auroara (Coming Soon)
**A privacy-first, connection-oriented social platform.** Auroara is my latest project, designed from the ground up with a focus on security and user data sovereignty.

* **Mission**: To create a safe, private space for authentic social connection.
* **Architecture**:
    * **Custom Backend**: Built with Node.js and a PostgreSQL database, featuring a custom authentication system and robust security measures like Row-Level Security (RLS).
    * **End-to-End Encryption**: Implemented the Signal Protocol to ensure all user communications are private and secure.
    * **Native Mobile**: Developing native clients for both Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift/SwiftUI) for optimal performance and user experience.
* **Website**: [auroarasocial.com](https://auroarasocial.com) (coming soon)

#### LezFindr
**A community-centric dating and social app for lesbian, queer, and trans individuals.** This app was my first major solo project, taking it from concept to a published application on two platforms.

* **Mission**: To foster genuine connections and build community beyond the swipe.
* **Tech**: Built with **Flutter** for the cross-platform frontend and **Firebase** for a scalable, real-time backend.
